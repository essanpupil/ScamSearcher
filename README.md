# ScamSearcher
ScamSearcher is an application with the goal to search for scam website. In this early stage, the target is web scam using Indonesian language.

I divide this project into steps:

1. make sure python module (WebScraper) is accessible via web interface. [DONE]

2. develop the app so that operator can insert keyword, start manual search, save the search result in the database, fetch the website, inspect the website, label the scam website, tokenize the scam website, compare the scam website's token.

3. all the above + authentication system, client & event system

4. all the above + automatic search & compare system

5. reporting scam website to its respective hosting (experimental)
